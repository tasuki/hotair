# Hot Air

Hot air balloon "game". I wrote this game when 13 years old. In Visual Basic.
It was my first computer program. Now rewriting in Elm, mostly... to see what
Elm is like, I guess?

## Install/Run

On Ubuntu, install Elm and run the reactor in this directory:

```
$ npm install elm
$ elm reactor
```

Do whatever elm reactor tells you to, probably visit http://localhost:8000.
